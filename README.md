# LIFE-EXPECTANCY-PROJECT
IN THIS DATASET WE HAVE TO PREDICT THE LIFE EXPECTANCY OF THE VARIOUS COUNTRIES IN A GIVEN TIME PERIOD. I FOUND OUT THAT XGBOOST GIVES THE BEST RESULT ON ADJUSTING THE HYPER PARAMETER AND GIVES RMSE OF AROUND 2.5 ON THE TEST SET .MOREOVER RANDOM FOREST GIVES THE COMPARABLE PERFORMANCE BUT TAKES FAR MORE TIME TO COMPLETE THAN XGBOOST. WITHOUT HYPER-PARAMETER ADJUSTMENT  EXTRA TREE PERFORMS VERY WELL TOO COMPARED TO THE TIME OTHER MODELS TAKE. LINEAR REGRESSION PERFORMS THE WORST OVERALL.
